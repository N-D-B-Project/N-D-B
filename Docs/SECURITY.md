I Miguel Alexandre Uhlein (NedcloarBR) takes the security of my products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through my GitHub Repositories

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my Projects, please report it to me as described below.

# Reporting Security Issues
