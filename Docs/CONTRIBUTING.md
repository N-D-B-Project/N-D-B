# Before Contributing

### 1. Search for Duplicates

Search the existing [issues](https://github.com/NedcloarBR/N-D-B/issues) or [Pull Requests](https://github.com/NedcloarBR/N-D-B/pulls) before creating a new one.

Some search tips:

- Don't restrict your search to only open issues. An issue with a title similar to yours may have been closed as a duplicate of one with a less-findable title.
- Check for synonyms. For example, if your bug involves an interface, it likely also occurs with type aliases or classes.
- Search for the title of the issue you're about to log. This sounds obvious but 80% of the time this is sufficient to find a duplicate when one exists.
- Read more than the first page of results. Many bugs here use the same words so relevancy sorting is not particularly strong.
- If you have a crash, search for the first few topmost function names shown in the call stack.

### 2. Read the FAQ

Please [read the FAQ](https://github.com/NedcloarBR/N-D-B/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md) before creating new issues, even if you think you have found a bug.

### 3. Do you have a question?

Enter in the [Discord Support Server](http://discord.gg/5CHARxbaRk) go to the [#Support](https://discord.com/channels/679066351456878633/1128728836247388190) Channel and create an post with your question!

### 4. Did you find a bug?

When logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:

- What version of TypeScript you're using (run `tsc --v`)
- What version of Discord.js you're using (run `npm list discord.js`)
- What version of Node.js you're using (run `node --version`)
- What version of Java you're using (run `java --version`)

If at all possible, an isolated way to reproduce the behavior
The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior

### 5. Do you have a suggestion?

I also accept suggestions in the issue tracker. Be sure to check the [FAQ](https://github.com/NedcloarBR/N-D-B/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md) and [search](https://github.com/NedcloarBR/N-D-B/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) first.

In general, things we find useful when reviewing suggestions are:

- A description of the problem you're trying to solve
- An overview of the suggested solution
- Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places
  - Code examples showing e.g. "this would be an error, this wouldn't"
  - Code examples showing the generated JavaScript (if applicable)
- If relevant, precedent in other languages can be useful for establishing context and expected behavior

**NOTE:** Contributing would be great as i'm a solo developer for this bot.

You can help contribute by:

- Translation language files (help with previous translations or make support for another language)
- Optimization on files. (Know a better way on a function, make a pull request and I'll have a look)
- Donating (Donating helps me stay motivated to providing open source code, that anyone can use)
